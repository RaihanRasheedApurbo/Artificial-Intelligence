This is a board game called Line of Action.
We can play both 1vs1 and we can also play with computer AI.

Here AI was built using the theories of adverserial search and alpha beta pruning
AI was built using features like -
piece square table
quad
connectedness
mobility
density
read the specs and features of AI file for more information


issues:

I got only 2 weeks to do this whole assignment. A project was given in place of assignment.
So I couldn't polish the UI

But here we can play in both 6*6 board and 8*8 board you just need to change
online in the code to change the boardlength. Could have taken this input graphically

Should have used thread to produce AI move. In that way GUI would be more smooth.

In future we can experiment machine learning techinique using this project also.
