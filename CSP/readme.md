This is a solution of a famous constraint satisfaction problem....
LatinSquareSolve.cpp has all the required code to solve a latin square...
There are some test input given as well. 

I implemented two schemes which are naive backtracking and forward checking brelaz heuristic.

Their performance can be realized by opening AI-CSP-Report.docx

Possible future improvements-
1. We can use IBS heuristics (details on insturctions_for_csp_task.pdf and CSP file)
2. we can use priority queue instead of linear search
3. We should use strong value ordering techniques based on IBS.
